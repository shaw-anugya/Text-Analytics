While I was in the local Walmart on November 4, 2016, there were customer representatives from Xfinity running promotions for and in the Salt Lake City area. Spoke with a representative and was able to get and signed a contract for Pro Blast at $50.00 a month with no contract or early termination fees. I received an email from Xfinity stating the changes that would be made to my account. It stated that not only would it be under contract for 24 months but there would be early termination fees. This is not what I had originally signed up for and it specifically states this on the contract that I signed. Contacted Xfinity customer service and was told since they cannot see the contract over the phone that I would need to go to Xfinity store in person. Went to Xfinity store on November 8, 2016 and was told that it would be under contract and there was no way around it. Because of this I have cancelled the upgrade and went back to my original plan. It's plain and simple. When a contract is signed it should be honored for what is stated on it. Xfinity is dishonest and not trustworthy. Therefore I will be looking and changing my ISP as soon as possible to another company. Xfinity does not deserve a paycheck from me or anyone else that I know."
